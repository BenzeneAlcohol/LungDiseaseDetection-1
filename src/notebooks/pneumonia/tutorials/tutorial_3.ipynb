You'll notice that this notebook has been split up into multiple sections; this is to make things easier to read, reuse and navigate.

Use this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started) to learn more about this. You've already created a tensorflow callback in tutorial_3 and trained the model with it. All that's left to do is fire it up.\n","\n","- Create a test generator. This step is similar to making train and validation generators except that you don't add any augmentation. Make sure you still rescale the image.\n","\n","- Evaluate the model on the test set. Print the metric names and their corresponding values returned (metrics are loss, accuracy, precision and recall). Use this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#evaluate) to learn more. \n","\n","- Make predictions on the test set. If you used the sequential API, \"predict_classes\" method should work for this.
