        "# ResNet from Scratch.\n",
        "Addition of more and more layers to a network would result in saturation in accuracy and then the accuracy also starts decreasing. ResNets have been very useful in this case. They have skip-connections between alternate layers. One block of such a connection is called as a residual block. This allows us to feed activations from one layer to the deeper layers without the problem of vanishing gradients. \n",

        "The architecture of ResNet-34:\n",
        "* First layer is a convolutional layer with kernel of 7x7 and 64 filters. This is folowed by a max pooling layer. \n",
        "* After that there are several layers (in pairs because of the skip connections) with 3x3 kernel size and different number of filters (64, 128, 256, 512).\n",
