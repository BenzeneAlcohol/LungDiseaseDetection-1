You can use the headings of next sections in an actual notebook as is.

Change the name of the notebook so that it has the format 'dataset_architecture_trainingStyle'. Assuming that this notebook is for the pneumonia dataset and implements an AlexNet model from scratch, it would be called \"pneumonia_alexnet_custom\". <br><br>\n","The next step is to mention the same details clearly at the very beggining of the notebook. Use a **table** to mention these details. The text cell in colab supports markdown and HTML so use whichever is comforable for you. It should look something like the next cell.

Check this [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/how-to-load-kaggle-datasets-directly-into-google-colab/) for more information. The datasets are linked in the proposal. Download the pneumonia dataset for this tutorial. <br> <br>\n","Once the dataset is loaded, you might notice that the train-val split is not very good. The train directory has over 5000 examples and the val directory has only 16. This needs to be changed. Here are the steps that you can take to do that (if you think you can do it more efficiently, please do!):\n","1. Create a directory for a 'working_dataset' using a ! followed by the command line instruction; **mkdir** (shown in the next cell). Check out this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/01.05-IPython-And-Shell-Commands.ipynb) on IPython shell commands for more information. \n","2. Create subdirectories for train and val images. In each of those, create subdirectories for NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. \n","3. Move the test directory to the 'working_dataset' as is. You can use the **mv** command for this. \n","4. Make a list of all the files in the train and val directories of the kaggle dataset. Each element of the list is the full path of the file. \n","5. Shuffle this list randomly (use the random library functions).\n","6. Split the list in an appropriate ratio. About 500 images for the val dataset seems reasonable, but pick whatever you feel makes sense. \n","7. Transfer the files to the appropriate locations in the 'working_dataset'\n","8. **Move the working dataset to your drive**. Make sure it was mounted to the notebook first. This step is important. Without this, you'll have to redo the split every time you run the notebook. \n","9. Create a folder in your drive to store the weights. \n","\n","This step is really important to get right but the good news is that you have to do it in just one notebook. Once the 'working_dataset' is on your drive, you can use that everywhere else.<br><br>Remember to add **comments** in these cells so you can come back to them later if required and know they're doing."],"metadata":{"id":"D3tEF0F4hvBl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# example to make a directory and then move it\n","! mkdir some_directory\n","! mv /content/some_directory /content/drive/MyDrive"],"metadata":{"id":"pxrKwaWCk_LQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["When writing function for anything in a notebook, make sure you include a description of the function at the beginning.
